# FrisbeeDetection

## Introduction

Frisbee Detection is an open-source project designed to assist ultimate frisbee teams and disc enthusiasts in capturing their playing moments effortlessly. Due to the size of the field and limited camera viewing angles, current recording methods often require a person on the sideline to hold a phone or camera, resulting in unstable and blurred videos. Our goal is to leverage computer vision techniques and gimbal technology to automatically detect, track, and record the disc and players, ensuring that no important moments are missed.

## Getting Involved

As an individual developer, my knowledge and capabilities are limited. Therefore, if you are interested in this project and have experience in Object Tracking, UI Development, or Gimbal Control, I invite you to collaborate with me. Please reach out at yangchle1999@gmail.com. Additionally, if you have any creative ideas or suggestions, feel free to send me an email.

## Future Plans

Here is the roadmap for the development of this project:

Disc and Player Detection and Tracking on PC: Utilize YOLOv8 and OpenCV to detect and track the disc and players on a personal computer.
Mobile App Development: Create a mobile application incorporating the functionality developed in phase 1.
Gimbal Control Integration: Implement gimbal control to synchronize with the object tracking system.
Mobile App Gimbal Control: Integrate gimbal control features into the mobile application.
Additional Features: Enhance the application with features such as game data analysis, specific player detection, and live streaming capabilities.
